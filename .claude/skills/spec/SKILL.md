# /spec - Governance Artifact Maintenance

Maintain governance artifacts for: `$ARGUMENTS`

Use this workflow for spec-only governance work: refine or accept ADRs, clarify or amend RFCs, update artifact references, and validate/render governance output without implementing code.

**Outputs:** Updated governance artifacts, completed artifact review, and validated rendered governance state.

**Artifact roles:** RFCs define obligations, ADRs explain decisions, and work items track execution. `/spec` only maintains the first two.

## Critical Rules

1. Artifact-only scope. Do not write implementation code in this workflow.
2. No work item by default. This workflow is for governance maintenance, not implementation tracking.
3. Ask permission before lifecycle-owned verbs: `govctl adr accept`, `govctl adr reject`, `govctl adr supersede`, `govctl rfc finalize`, and `govctl rfc bump`.
4. Do not advance RFC phase out of `spec` here. Hand off to `/gov` when implementation-bearing work begins.
5. Clarification-only RFC updates must not silently change behavior. If behavior changes, stop and route through `/discuss` and `/gov`.
6. Never edit governed files directly. Use `govctl` verbs only.
7. Validate with `govctl check`, and run `govctl render` when rendered docs should change.
8. Use `/commit` for raw VCS operations. This workflow defines what to record, not how to invoke VCS directly.
9. Do not let RFCs absorb implementation structure or let ADRs absorb work-item execution details. Preserve artifact roles while editing.
10. Do not bump an RFC again merely because its current version is already in `spec`; edits there belong to that version candidate.

## Quick Reference

```bash
govctl status
govctl rfc list
govctl rfc show <RFC-ID>
govctl adr list
govctl adr show <ADR-ID>

govctl adr set <ADR-ID> context --stdin <<'EOF' ... EOF
govctl adr add <ADR-ID> alternatives "Option: ..."
govctl adr add <ADR-ID> alternatives "Other option: ..." --reject-reason "Why it was not chosen"
govctl adr tick <ADR-ID> alternatives --at 1 -s rejected
govctl adr tick <ADR-ID> alternatives --at 0 -s accepted
govctl adr set <ADR-ID> decision --stdin <<'EOF' ... EOF
govctl adr set <ADR-ID> consequences --stdin <<'EOF' ... EOF
govctl adr accept <ADR-ID>

govctl clause edit <RFC-ID>:C-<NAME> text --stdin <<'EOF' ... EOF
govctl rfc bump <RFC-ID> --patch -m "Clarify clause wording"
govctl rfc get <RFC-ID> changelog
govctl rfc edit <RFC-ID> changelog.summary --set "Clarify current version"
govctl rfc finalize <RFC-ID> normative

govctl check
govctl render
```

## Workflow

### 1. Classify the task

Choose the narrowest fit:

- **ADR maintenance**: refine a proposed ADR, add alternatives/refs, or accept it
- **RFC clarification**: tighten wording or fill specification gaps without changing behavior
- **RFC amendment**: change normative requirements without implementing them yet
- **Governance-only cleanup**: fix artifact references, rendering output, or metadata

If the task requires implementation, testing implementation behavior, or phase advancement beyond `spec`, stop and use `/gov`.

### 2. Gather context

```bash
govctl status
govctl rfc list
govctl adr list
```

Then read the relevant artifacts:

```bash
govctl rfc show <RFC-ID>
govctl adr show <ADR-ID>
```

Human-readable `show` defaults to the current projection and omits obsolete
RFC, ADR, and Clause bodies. Use `--history` when auditing or amending a
deprecated or superseded artifact. JSON, YAML, and TOML `show` output is always
complete and cannot be combined with `--history`.

Before editing a normative RFC, inspect its current phase. The phase determines
whether the edit remains in the current version candidate or must be released as
a new version.

For artifact editing conventions, follow the appropriate writer skill:

- RFC changes -> **rfc-writer**
- ADR changes -> **adr-writer**

### 3. Edit the artifacts

Use `govctl` verbs only.

For ADR work:

- Refine `context`, `alternatives`, `decision`, `consequences`, and `refs`
- If the ADR is ready to become authoritative, ask permission before `govctl adr accept <ADR-ID>`

For RFC work:

- Edit clauses with `govctl clause edit`
- If the RFC is draft, do not bump it; when ready, ask permission before `govctl rfc finalize <RFC-ID> normative`
- If a normative RFC is in `spec`, edit the current version candidate directly; do not bump it again for those edits
- If a normative RFC is in `impl`, `test`, or `stable`, an RFC or Clause edit creates an unversioned amendment; after review, ask permission before using `govctl rfc bump` to release it as the next version in `spec`
- If a normative RFC in `impl`, `test`, or `stable` lacks a sealed signature, stop and run migration or restore the baseline; do not use a bump to infer it
- If the RFC is deprecated, do not edit or version-bump it
- Use `govctl rfc edit <RFC-ID> changelog.*` for current-version changelog corrections; these do not change version, phase, or the sealed content signature
- Delete an unreferenced Clause only in a draft RFC or when it was introduced in the current normative `spec` candidate (`since` equals the RFC version); inherited Clauses require deprecation or supersession

Semver guidance for RFC amendments:

- `--patch`: clarification or wording fix with no behavioral change
- `--minor`: additive requirement or newly specified behavior
- `--major`: breaking or incompatible requirement change

Every version-changing RFC bump must include a changelog summary via `-m`.
`--change` without a bump level is changelog-only and cannot release an RFC or
Clause content amendment.

### 4. Review and validate

Run the appropriate reviewer before finalizing artifact state:

- RFC changes -> **rfc-reviewer**
- ADR changes -> **adr-reviewer**

Then validate:

```bash
govctl check
govctl render
```

Fix validation or reviewer issues before recording the result.

### 5. Record the result

Spec-only governance commits may be recorded without a work item.

Use commit types that reflect artifact maintenance:

- `docs(rfc)`: RFC drafting, clarification, or amendment
- `docs(adr)`: ADR drafting or acceptance preparation
- `chore(gov)`: governance metadata, refs, render output, or config cleanup

Use `/commit` to record those changes.

If the task grows into implementation work, stop here and hand off to `/gov`.

## Handoff Rules

- Use `/discuss` when the design itself is still unresolved
- Use `/gov` when code or tests must change
- Use `/quick` only for standalone non-behavioral cleanup outside governance artifacts

## Examples

### Accept a reviewed ADR

1. Read the ADR with `govctl adr show <ADR-ID>`
2. Run **adr-reviewer**
3. Fix issues
4. Ask permission, then run `govctl adr accept <ADR-ID>`
5. Run `govctl check`

### Clarify an RFC without changing behavior

1. Inspect the RFC phase with `govctl rfc show <RFC-ID>`
2. Edit the clause text with `govctl clause edit`
3. Run **rfc-reviewer**
4. For a draft RFC, keep the version and finalize when ready; for a normative RFC already in `spec`, keep the current version; for a normative RFC in `impl`, `test`, or `stable`, ask permission, then run `govctl rfc bump <RFC-ID> --patch -m "Clarify wording"`
5. Run `govctl check` and `govctl render`

### Prepare a deprecation plan without implementation

1. Update the RFC language to mark the behavior deprecated
2. Record the rationale and migration guidance
3. Review and validate the artifact changes
4. Hand off to `/gov` for actual implementation or removal work

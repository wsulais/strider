# Work Item Writer

Write work items with clear descriptions and actionable acceptance criteria.

## Invocation Mode

This helper skill may be used standalone or by `/gov`, `/quick`, or `/commit`.
It is responsible for work-item content quality and field semantics, not code changes or VCS operations.

## Authority

Work items track durable operational state: task scope, lifecycle, acceptance criteria, dependencies, references, and notes that should remain after closure.
They are operational memory, not normative authority and not decision records.

## Quick Reference

```bash
govctl work new --active "<title>"
govctl work set <WI-ID> description "Task scope description"
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "<category>: <description>"
govctl work add <WI-ID> notes "Durable constraint or retry rule"
govctl work add <WI-ID> refs RFC-NNNN
govctl work add <WI-ID> depends_on <BLOCKING-WI-ID>
govctl work add <WI-ID> tags <tag>
govctl work tick <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "<pattern>" -s done
govctl work move <WI-ID> done
```

## Work Item Structure

### Title

Concise, action-oriented. Describes _what_ will be done.

- Good: "Add validation for clause cross-references"
- Bad: "Fix stuff" or "Work on the thing"

### Description

**Purpose:** Task scope declaration — what needs to be done.

Replace the placeholder immediately. One paragraph explaining:

- What the work accomplishes
- Why it's needed
- Any relevant context

**Important:** Description is for task scope, NOT execution tracking. Use loop state and round artifacts for execution trace, and `notes` only for closure-worthy durable learnings that belong on the work item.
It must not introduce new product behavior requirements that are missing from the governing RFC or ADR.

### Execution Trace

**Where execution information goes now:**

- Round-by-round execution trace belongs in loop state and round artifacts.
- Durable lessons, constraints, and retry rules that should still matter after closure belong in `notes`.
- Acceptance progress belongs in `acceptance_criteria` status.

### Notes

**Purpose:** Closure-worthy durable context — stable constraints, decisions, and retry rules that should remain useful after the work item is done.

Use notes sparingly for:

- Why an approach must not be retried because of a stable technical reason
- Constraints or decisions future maintainers must obey
- Important implementation facts that are not obvious from the final diff

These notes may explain local execution constraints, but they do not override RFCs or accepted ADRs.
Do not use notes for progress updates, commands run, validation output, current plans, next actions, temporary blockers, hypotheses, review status, or "remember to do X" TODOs.

```bash
govctl work add <WI-ID> notes "Do not retry the legacy JSON migration path; v0.9 intentionally rejects it"
govctl work add <WI-ID> notes "Legacy inline journal entries must remain render-only for older work items"
```

### Acceptance Criteria

**Every criterion MUST have a category prefix** for changelog generation:

| Prefix       | Changelog Section | Aliases                           |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `add:`       | Added             | `feat:`, `feature:`, `added:`     |
| `fix:`       | Fixed             | `fixed:`                          |
| `change:`    | Changed           | `changed:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`  |
| `remove:`    | Removed           | `removed:`                        |
| `deprecate:` | Deprecated        | `deprecated:`                     |
| `security:`  | Security          | `sec:`                            |
| `chore:`     | _(excluded)_      | `test:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `build:` |

```bash
# Feature work
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "add: Implement clause validation"
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "add: Error messages include clause ID"

# Bug fix
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "fix: Duplicate clause detection"

# Internal
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "chore: All tests pass"
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "chore: govctl check passes"
```

### References

Link to governing artifacts:

```bash
govctl work add <WI-ID> refs RFC-0001
govctl work add <WI-ID> refs ADR-0023
```

### Dependencies and Batches

Create multiple work items only when each item is independently meaningful to future readers:

- Each work item should represent a durable outcome, user-visible behavior, spec/ADR obligation, or independently reviewable deliverable.
- Do not create work items for mechanical helper extraction, fixture sharing, file moves, module normalization, formatting, comment cleanup, snapshot reshaping, or other low-level execution steps.
- For trivial cleanup or docs-only edits, no work item may be the right answer; follow the invoking workflow instead of inventing tracking.
- For one coherent cleanup/refactor, prefer one coarse work item over many narrow slices.
- Use `depends_on` only for hard execution ordering; keep `refs` for informational links.
- Use a loop for non-trivial governed execution that needs local execution memory, including single-work-item execution after journal-style trace moved out of Work Item fields.
- Use one multi-work-item loop only when there are multiple durable work items; do not use loops to justify creating mechanical work-item fragments.
- Let govctl generate the loop ID with `govctl loop start <ROOT-WI-ID> [<ROOT-WI-ID>...]`; use the returned `LOOP-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` ID for later loop commands.
- Use `govctl loop list open` to discover existing non-terminal loops before resuming interrupted batch work.

If the batch scope changes after the loop starts, update the same loop:

```bash
govctl loop add <LOOP-ID> work <ROOT-WI-ID>
govctl loop remove <LOOP-ID> work <ROOT-WI-ID>
govctl loop replan <LOOP-ID>
```

`work` is the editable loop work-item field. `wi` is accepted as a short alias, but examples should prefer `work`.

Do not hand-write descriptive loop IDs or encode time finer than the day in loop IDs.

## Field Semantics Summary

| Field                 | Purpose                | Update Pattern                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `description`         | Task scope declaration | Define once, rarely change                   |
| `notes`               | Durable learnings      | Add only when useful after work-item closure |
| `acceptance_criteria` | Completion criteria    | Define then tick                             |

**Per ADR-0047:** Keep description focused on "what", notes on closure-worthy durable context, and execution trace outside the work item field surface.
If you discover a missing requirement or unresolved design choice, stop and route that back to RFC/ADR work rather than inventing it inside the work item.

## Writing Rules

### Authority Test

Before adding description, notes, or acceptance criteria, apply these checks:

- **Task scope:** Work item fields describe what this task must complete, not the product contract itself.
- **Governing refs:** New user-visible behavior, CLI behavior, storage format, validation rule, compatibility rule, or lifecycle rule must be backed by RFC/ADR refs.
- **Design destination:** If the text explains why a design option was chosen, move it to an ADR.
- **Execution destination:** If the text records progress, commands run, validation output, review status, temporary blockers, hypotheses, or next actions, move it to loop state, round artifacts, or the final response.
- **Durability:** Keep notes only when the fact should remain useful after the work item is closed.

Examples:

| Statement                                                                           | Destination                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `changed: Reviewer agents include boundary findings for RFC/ADR/WI authority drift` | Work Item                          |
| `The reviewer MUST emit Boundary Findings for every artifact review.`               | RFC, if this is a product contract |
| `We will keep review policy in agent prompts rather than deterministic check code.` | ADR                                |
| `Ran govctl check; next fix rfc-reviewer wording.`                                  | Loop evidence or final response    |

### Acceptance Criteria Quality

Each criterion should be:

- **Specific** — "Add `validate_refs()` function" not "Add validation"
- **Testable** — Can be verified as done/not-done with no ambiguity
- **Independent** — Each criterion stands alone
- **Categorized** — Always include the category prefix

### Completion Flow

Work items cannot be marked done without ticking all criteria:

```bash
# Tick criteria as you complete them
govctl work tick <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "<pattern>" -s done

# When all criteria are done, close the work item
govctl work move <WI-ID> done
```

### The `chore:` Pattern

Always add at least one `chore:` criterion for validation:

```bash
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "chore: govctl check passes"
```

This ensures validation is an explicit gate, not an afterthought.

### Guardable Command Checks

Prefer verification guards over plain acceptance criteria for repeatable command-style checks.
When a criterion is only "`cargo test` passes", "`clippy` passes", or another shell command succeeds, first check whether an existing guard already covers it.
If so, require that guard through the work item's `[verification]` section instead of duplicating the command as a behavioral acceptance criterion.
Use `verification.required_guards` for per-work-item guard requirements.

Project-level `verification.default_guards` apply broadly to work-item completion when verification is enabled.
Use work-item-level `verification.required_guards` to add task-specific guards on top of those defaults, not to repeat guards that already apply globally.
Waivers apply to the effective guard set: project defaults plus work-item-specific required guards.

```toml
[verification]
required_guards = ["GUARD-CARGO-TEST"]
```

Use acceptance criteria for observable task outcomes.
Keep `chore:` criteria for validation summaries, especially when the validation is not fully enforced by a guard or the work item needs an explicit closure checklist item.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                            | Fix                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Missing category prefix            | Always use `add:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.                                                                |
| Placeholder description left in    | Replace immediately with real description                                                                |
| Vague criteria: "Feature works"    | Specific: "add: CLI returns exit code 0 on success"                                                      |
| No `chore:` criterion              | Add "chore: govctl check passes" or "chore: all tests pass"                                              |
| No refs to governing artifacts     | Link RFCs/ADRs with `work add <WI-ID> refs`                                                              |
| Description used for tracking      | Use loop state and round artifacts for execution trace                                                   |
| Progress details stored as notes   | Keep `notes` durable; put transient round logs in loop state and round artifacts                         |
| TODOs or next actions stored notes | Put next actions in loop state or the final response; use acceptance criteria for completion obligations |
| Mechanical substeps become WIs     | Use no WI or one coarse WI; leave helper/test/file-move details to the commit diff                       |
| Work item invents new requirements | Move those requirements into an RFC or ADR first                                                         |

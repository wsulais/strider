# /gov - Governed Workflow

Execute a complete, auditable workflow for: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Outputs:** Implemented change, updated governance artifacts where needed, validated tests/checks, and a completed work item.

## Agent Patterns

### CLI choice

Use `govctl` for governance operations.

When working on the `govctl` repo itself, use `cargo run --quiet --` instead. Commands below use `govctl` for brevity.

### Non-interactive commands

Use non-interactive CLI commands only. Prefer `--stdin` for multi-line content.

### Verification

After each governance write or substantive code change, run the relevant validation (`govctl check`, tests, render when needed).

## Quick Reference

```bash
govctl status
govctl work list pending
govctl work show <WI-ID>
govctl work new --active "<title>"
govctl work move <WI-ID> <status>
govctl work set <WI-ID> description "Scope and why"
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "add: Implement feature X"
govctl work add <WI-ID> refs RFC-0001
govctl work add <WI-ID> tags <tag>
govctl work add <WI-ID> depends_on <BLOCKING-WI-ID>
govctl tag new <tag>
govctl tag list
govctl loop list open
govctl loop start <ROOT-WI-ID> [<ROOT-WI-ID>...]
govctl loop run <LOOP-ID>
govctl loop replan <LOOP-ID>
govctl loop add <LOOP-ID> work <ROOT-WI-ID>
govctl loop remove <LOOP-ID> work <ROOT-WI-ID>
govctl rfc list
govctl adr list
govctl rfc new "<title>"
govctl adr new "<title>"
govctl rfc finalize <RFC-ID> normative
govctl rfc advance <RFC-ID> <impl|test|stable>
govctl check
govctl render
```

## Critical Rules

1. Use `govctl` for governance operations. Never edit governed files directly.
2. Respect phase discipline: `spec -> impl -> test -> stable`.
3. Behavior changes must be grounded in a normative RFC. If behavior is unspecified or ambiguous, stop and escalate.
4. Ask permission before `govctl rfc finalize ...` or `govctl rfc advance ...` unless `$ARGUMENTS` explicitly grant full authority.
5. Keep an active work item while performing substantive implementation. `govctl check --has-active` is the pre-implementation gate, not a commit prerequisite; a completed work item may move to `done` before the final implementation commit.
6. In source comments, reference artifacts with `[[artifact-id]]`.
7. Use work item fields correctly:
   - `description`: task scope and why; set once, rarely change
   - `notes`: closure-worthy durable facts only; record stable constraints, decisions, and retry rules that should still matter after the work item is done
8. Avoid retry cycles. If the same approach already failed, do not repeat it unchanged.
9. Spec-only governance maintenance does not belong here. Use `/spec` when no implementation work is required.
10. Work items are operational memory, not normative authority. If implementation needs a new requirement or design decision, amend the RFC or ADR instead of stuffing it into `description` or `notes`.
11. Create work items for durable, reader-useful outcomes only. Do not create separate work items for mechanical helper extraction, fixture sharing, file moves, formatting, or cleanup substeps.
12. Do not invent loop IDs. Omit `--id` when starting a loop; use the generated `LOOP-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` ID printed by the command for later `run`, `show`, `replan`, `add`, or `remove`.

## Work Item Context

The active work item is durable outcome context. Read it with `govctl work show <WI-ID>`; do not rely on raw TOML.

### Read order

1. `description` tells you the scope.
2. `notes` tells you closure-worthy constraints or lessons that should survive future sessions.
3. `acceptance_criteria` tells you what must be true before closure.

### Write rules

- Do not add `notes` by default. Add one only when the fact should remain useful after the work item is closed.
- Never put progress, command output, review status, current plan, next action, temporary blocker, hypothesis, or "remember to do X" TODOs in `notes`.
- Record execution trace, failed attempts, blockers, and next actions in loop state and round artifacts. If no loop exists, report them in the final response instead of writing them to the work item.
- On failure, add a note only when you discovered a stable retry rule such as "Do not retry parser path X; it cannot preserve normalized arrays."

### Loop usage

Use a loop for non-trivial governed execution that needs local execution memory. This includes single-Work-Item work now that transient journal-style execution trace belongs in loop state and round artifacts. Multi-Work-Item loops add dependency and batch coordination; they are not permission to split one cleanup/refactor into mechanical work-item fragments.

1. Create or activate only the work items that represent durable outcomes a future reader should see.
2. Add `depends_on` edges for hard execution ordering.
3. Run `govctl check` so dependency cycles or missing work item IDs are caught before the loop starts.
4. Start one loop for the root set with `govctl loop start <ROOT-WI-ID> [<ROOT-WI-ID>...]`; let govctl generate the `LOOP-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` ID.
5. Run `govctl loop run <LOOP-ID>` to open a local round for ready work.
6. Perform implementation, verification, and any explicit `govctl work move` commands yourself.
7. Fill the opened `.govctl/loops/<LOOP-ID>/rounds/round-NNN.toml` summary evidence.
8. Run `govctl loop run <LOOP-ID>` again to validate and close the round.

When resuming after an interruption or inspecting current local execution state, run `govctl loop list open` first. Use the listed generated loop ID for `run`, `show`, `resume`, `add`, `remove`, or `replan`; do not guess a loop ID from memory.

`govctl loop run` advances local round state only. It does not implement code, tick acceptance criteria, add notes, or move Work Items to `done`.

If the scope changes during execution, keep the same loop identity:

- Use `govctl loop add <LOOP-ID> work <ROOT-WI-ID>` when newly discovered work belongs in the current batch.
- Use `govctl loop remove <LOOP-ID> work <ROOT-WI-ID>` when a root no longer belongs in the batch.
- Use `govctl loop replan <LOOP-ID>` after dependency edits that should refresh the current closure.

`work` is the editable loop work-item field. `wi` is accepted as a short alias, but examples should prefer `work`.

Do not create multiple scattered loops for work that belongs in one coherent execution session.

Do not create separate work items for low-level implementation slices such as helper moves, test fixture sharing, module normalization, comment cleanup, snapshot reshaping, or other changes whose only durable record should be the commit diff or one higher-level work item.

## Workflow

### 0. Initialize

```bash
govctl status
```

- Read `gov/config.toml`.
- Classify the task:
  - Doc-only: use `/quick` or `/spec` unless the user explicitly wants `/gov`
  - Bug fix: usually no new RFC if behavior is already specified
  - Feature: likely requires an RFC or ADR
  - Deprecation or removal: amend the governing RFC before implementation
  - Refactor: ADR may be needed if it changes architecture

### 1. Resolve the work item

```bash
govctl work list pending
```

- Matching active item: use it
- Matching queued item: `govctl work move <WI-ID> active`
- No match and the task has one durable outcome: `govctl work new --active "<concise-title>"`, then start a loop if the work is non-trivial
- No match and the task has multiple independently reviewable durable outcomes: create that small batch first, wire only hard `depends_on` edges, then start one generated-ID loop for the batch.
- No match and the apparent split is only mechanical implementation steps: create at most one coarse work item, or route trivial cleanup to `/quick`.

Then immediately:

```bash
govctl work show <WI-ID>
govctl work set <WI-ID> description "Brief scope: what and why"
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "chore: govctl check passes"
```

Add task-specific acceptance criteria and refs as needed:

```bash
govctl work add <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "add: Implement feature X"
govctl work add <WI-ID> refs RFC-0001
```

Follow the **wi-writer** skill for acceptance criteria quality.

### 2. Analyze governance

Skip this step for doc-only changes.

```bash
govctl rfc list
govctl adr list
```

Choose the smallest thing that matches reality:

- New behavior not covered by an RFC: draft an RFC
- Ambiguous interpretation or architectural choice: draft an ADR
- Deprecation or removal of specified behavior: amend the governing RFC first
- Existing normative RFC already specifies the change: proceed
- Spec-only artifact maintenance with no implementation: stop and use `/spec`

If you create artifacts:

- Follow `rfc-writer` or `adr-writer`
- Review drafts with the appropriate reviewer agent
- Fix critical findings before implementation

### 3. Enter implementation

Before writing code:

```bash
govctl check --has-active
```

For RFC-governed work, verify the RFC state:

- `draft/spec`: do not bump; ask permission, then finalize and advance to `impl`
- `normative/spec`: continue authoring the current version without another bump; ask permission before advancing to `impl`, which seals its RFC and Clause content
- `normative/impl+`: proceed against the sealed current-version baseline; when RFC or Clause content needs to change, edit it to form an unversioned amendment, then release that amendment with `govctl rfc bump` as the next version in `spec`
- `deprecated`: stop; do not edit or version-bump

If implementation reveals a spec bug, do not silently deviate:

- A code-only implementation defect does not require an RFC edit or bump.
- Editing RFC or Clause content after entry to `impl` creates an unversioned amendment. Do not advance to `test` while it exists.
- Release that amendment on the normative RFC with an appropriate patch, minor, or major `govctl rfc bump`; the new version starts in `spec`.
- Continue authoring that new version in `spec` without another bump, then advance to `impl` to seal the corrected baseline.
- A current-version changelog correction uses `govctl rfc edit <RFC-ID> changelog.*` and does not affect the sealed content baseline.
- If an RFC in `impl`, `test`, or `stable` has no sealed signature, stop lifecycle mutation. Run migration, or restore a consistent known-good baseline comprising the RFC TOML and its complete Clause TOML set from version-control history; do not reconstruct it from possibly amended content. See [[RFC-0000:C-PHASE-LIFECYCLE]].
- For a Clause introduced in the current normative `spec` candidate whose `since` equals the RFC version, use `govctl clause delete`; it scans all governed artifacts and reports every referrer before allowing deletion. Inherited Clauses use deprecate or supersede. See [[RFC-0000:C-CLAUSE-DEF]].

Ask before the lifecycle-owned bump unless the user already granted full authority.

Implementation rules:

1. Keep changes focused.
2. Follow RFC clauses and cite them in source comments when useful.
3. After each substantive change, run the relevant validation.
4. Add durable work-item notes only when a closure-worthy fact exists:

```bash
govctl work add <WI-ID> notes "Do not retry parser path X; it cannot preserve normalized arrays"
```

### 4. Test

If an RFC exists, ask permission before `govctl rfc advance <RFC-ID> test` unless full authority was granted.

Run the relevant verification for the change:

- `govctl check`
- Project tests
- Render commands when governed output changed

When the work item is ready to close, do not run `govctl verify --work <WI-ID>`
or manually repeat commands already covered by its effective guards immediately
before `govctl work move <WI-ID> done`. The move is the final verification gate
and runs those guards itself. Use standalone verification earlier for diagnosis
or when the work item will remain active.

If a check fails:

- Record the failed attempt in loop state or the final response
- Add a work-item note only for a stable retry rule that should survive closure
- Change approach before retrying

Do not continue until green.

If the change implements, removes, or materially alters RFC-governed behavior, invoke the **compliance-checker** agent before moving to `stable`.
Treat Critical compliance findings as a release gate; fix them before continuing.

### 5. Complete

Run final validation:

```bash
govctl check
govctl render
```

If an RFC exists and all required testing is done, ask permission before `govctl rfc advance <RFC-ID> stable` unless full authority was granted.

Before advancing to `stable` for RFC-governed behavior:

1. Run **compliance-checker**
2. Fix any Critical findings
3. Re-run the relevant checks if code changed

Before closing the work item:

1. Review the work item with `wi-reviewer`
2. Tick completed acceptance criteria
3. Move the work item to `done`; this runs its effective verification guards

Example:

```bash
govctl work show <WI-ID>
govctl work tick <WI-ID> acceptance_criteria "<pattern>" -s done
govctl work move <WI-ID> done
```

## Error Handling

### Stop and ask when

1. Requirements are ambiguous.
2. A normative RFC conflicts with the requested change.
3. The change would break existing behavior.
4. Security or secret-handling issues appear.
5. The task grows beyond the original scope.
6. The same failure recurs and you do not have a materially different next step.

### Otherwise recover and continue

| Problem                       | Recovery                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `govctl check` fails          | Read diagnostics, fix, rerun                                                               |
| Tests fail                    | Debug, fix, rerun                                                                          |
| `work move ... done` rejected | Add or tick acceptance criteria first                                                      |
| Same failure repeats          | Read durable `notes`; record the new plan in loop state or final response, or stop and ask |

## Commit Conventions

- `chore(work)`: activate or complete a work item
- `docs(rfc)` / `docs(adr)`: draft governance artifacts
- `feat(scope)` / `fix(scope)` / `refactor(scope)` / `docs(scope)` / `test(scope)`: implementation commits

Use the `commit` skill for all raw VCS operations.
